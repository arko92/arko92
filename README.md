### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Arko from India and have been living in Germany for over 5 years now. A computational engineer and physicist with several years of work experience in research, product, and scientific software development. As a consistent academic performer, I developed a strong theoretical foundation that, together with my employment history at different top MNC's allowed me to develop a diversified skill set. In addition, I have excellent communication and management skills. I always look forward to new employment opportunities which could have a positive global impact.
